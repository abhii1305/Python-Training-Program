  <h2>What is Colab?</h2>
</div>

Colab, or "Colaboratory", allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with
- Zero configuration required
- Access to GPUs free of charge
- Easy sharing

Whether you're a **student**, a **data scientist** or an **AI researcher**, Colab can make your work easier. Watch [Introduction to Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) to learn more, or just get started below!

a=int(input("enter a number"))
if(a==0):
  print("the number is zero:",a)
elif a<0:
  print("the number is negative:",a)
else:
  print(" the number is positive")

age = int(input(Enter your age))

"""<div class="markdown-google-sans">

## **Getting started**
</div>

The document you are reading is not a static web page, but an interactive environment called a **Colab notebook** that lets you write and execute code.

For example, here is a **code cell** with a short Python script that computes a value, stores it in a variable, and prints the result:
"""

seconds_in_a_day = 24 * 60 * 60
seconds_in_a_day

"""To execute the code in the above cell, select it with a click and then either press the play button to the left of the code, or use the keyboard shortcut "Command/Ctrl+Enter". To edit the code, just click the cell and start editing.

Variables that you define in one cell can later be used in other cells:
"""

seconds_in_a_week = 7 * seconds_in_a_day
seconds_in_a_week

"""Colab notebooks allow you to combine **executable code** and **rich text** in a single document, along with **images**, **HTML**, **LaTeX** and more. When you create your own Colab notebooks, they are stored in your Google Drive account. You can easily share your Colab notebooks with co-workers or friends, allowing them to comment on your notebooks or even edit them. To learn more, see [Overview of Colab](/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb). To create a new Colab notebook you can use the File menu above, or use the following link: [create a new Colab notebook](http://colab.research.google.com#create=true).

Colab notebooks are Jupyter notebooks that are hosted by Colab. To learn more about the Jupyter project, see [jupyter.org](https://www.jupyter.org).

<div class="markdown-google-sans">

## Data science
</div>

With Colab you can harness the full power of popular Python libraries to analyze and visualize data. The code cell below uses **numpy** to generate some random data, and uses **matplotlib** to visualize it. To edit the code, just click the cell and start editing.
"""

import numpy as np
import IPython.display as display
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import io
import base64

ys = 200 + np.random.randn(100)
x = [x for x in range(len(ys))]

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3), facecolor='w')
plt.plot(x, ys, '-')
plt.fill_between(x, ys, 195, where=(ys > 195), facecolor='g', alpha=0.6)
plt.title("Sample Visualization", fontsize=10)

data = io.BytesIO()
plt.savefig(data)
image = F"data:image/png;base64,{base64.b64encode(data.getvalue()).decode()}"
alt = "Sample Visualization"
display.display(display.Markdown(F"""![{alt}]({image})"""))
plt.close(fig)

"""You can import your own data into Colab notebooks from your Google Drive account, including from spreadsheets, as well as from Github and many other sources. To learn more about importing data, and how Colab can be used for data science, see the links below under [Working with Data](#working-with-data).

<div class="markdown-google-sans">

## Machine learning
</div>

With Colab you can import an image dataset, train an image classifier on it, and evaluate the model, all in just [a few lines of code](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb). Colab notebooks execute code on Google's cloud servers, meaning you can leverage the power of Google hardware, including [GPUs and TPUs](#using-accelerated-hardware), regardless of the power of your machine. All you need is a browser.

Colab is used extensively in the machine learning community with applications including:
- Getting started with TensorFlow
- Developing and training neural networks
- Experimenting with TPUs
- Disseminating AI research
- Creating tutorials

To see sample Colab notebooks that demonstrate machine learning applications, see the [machine learning examples](#machine-learning-examples) below.
